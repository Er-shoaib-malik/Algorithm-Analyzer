Algorithm Analyzer 🔍⚙️

An interactive Algorithm Analyzer built using React.js that helps visualize, analyze, and compare algorithms based on performance metrics like execution time, comparisons, and swaps.

This project bridges the gap between theoretical DSA concepts and real-world execution behavior through clear visualizations and metrics.

✨ Features

🔢 Algorithm Visualization

Step-by-step visualization of algorithms

Clear representation using animated bars

📊 Performance Analysis

Swap count

🎛️ Interactive Controls

Select algorithm dynamically

Generate new input arrays

Control animation speed

Start and reset execution

📈 Scalable Design

Easy to extend with more algorithms

Modular and clean code structure

🧠 Algorithms Implemented
Sorting Algorithms

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

(More algorithms like Binary Search, Graph Traversals, and Dynamic Programming will be added.)

🛠️ Tech Stack

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-analyzer.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
cd algorithm-analyzer

3. Install dependencies
npm install

4. Run the application
npm start


The app will run at http://localhost:3000.

📌 How It Works

User selects an algorithm.

A random input array is generated.

Algorithm runs while recording:

Comparisons

Swaps

Execution time

Each step is animated in real-time.

Metrics are displayed after execution.

This makes it easy to see why some algorithms perform better than others.
